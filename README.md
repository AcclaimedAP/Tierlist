# Tier list w/ links template incl. example
This is a Vue.js project that creates a tier list from an input(so far not decided, but probably JSON or an object.) It will format it in a pretty manner and then allow you to create links to these.

The example I will create this for is Genshin, but it can also be adjusted for any sort of tierlist you want. It will in this scenario rank them from S+ tier to D.
